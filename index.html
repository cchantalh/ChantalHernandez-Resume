        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Experience that I have obtained throughout my time in the workforce is not vast but is substantial. Beginning my experience was my first area of employment as a tutor for highschool students. During this I learned how to use different strategies of teaching to create the best effect of learning for my students I was teaching. As well as this, patience was something I had to build, as it is not always the simplest job to attempt to control a group of highschool students as a time. In my time at this establishment I would have six different groups of students to mentor during each different period of classes they had. This allowed me to meet and form bonds with several students-- all of which were different and required different methods of teaching to learn the materials they struggled in to the best extent. This is a cause as opposed to just teaching them the basics we had strived to implement long-term knowledge and displaying to them how to apply what they have learned to their everyday lives. After the time spent in this place of employment I decided that it was in my best interest to move forward to try a new experience at a different location.<br><br>

        Within my second place of employment I began as a team member at a frozen yogurt shop and began working a more flexible schedule which I was seeking from my previous employer. The environment supplies a very positive moodlet and allows for a more refreshing work day that anyone would be pleased to not only attend but do so joyfully. It is much simpler to juggle my work schedule and school with this employer as they provide more time to schedule tasks in between each shift. Skills I have obtained from working at this area are dealing with an assortment of individuals and handling them in a brisk and positive manner. Time management as well plays a factor in the fact that I must complete an array of tasks within the workday. <br><br>

        From the time I clock in I must plan what times to complete each activity and doing so while simultaneously serving and cleaning up after customers. Following instruction is another skill that I have built more so in my time at this establishment as I have to follow the recipes to create and put together the yogurts and toppings that we sell to customers. In this job we work more closely with our fellow coworkers as opposed to my previous employment and this has led to a more strengthened bond between one another. Job experiences do not rely only on you solely but how you work with others and this job has shown me that greatly. At times it is apparent that one member is struggling during a task and requires assistance and it has been something I have noticed lately from myself that I take it upon myself to assist them. This method is transactional as it is a mutual act of assistance.
